# OpenUI React

This UI library aims to take the research made by the core [OpenUI](https://open-ui.org/) team, and create React components that are both accessible and usable by default.

The OpenUI is a group of industry experts that are building a set of in-progress specifications for native web components that are usable and accessible. This in turn will allow web developers to style and extend their browser's built-in UI controls, instead of repeatedly reinventing them. 

This component library sets all of the necessary defaults to ensure your UI is both usable and accessible. The API of this library is also designed to map as close to the OpenUI's proposed behaviour as possible. As a result, when the OpenUI specifications make it to the browsers, this component library would be made mostly redundant.

While this library employs sane styling and behaviour, the appearance is left to be implemented in user land.

OpenUI React is made to bring the OpenUI specification to the browser, now. It's also a way to evaluate usage and understand how the components are being used in the wild.

It's very much a work in progress, so all feedback and contributions will be welcome.

Why do I want to make OpenUI React?

Help learn more about creating UI
Use the expertise of a number of industry professionals to inform the UI behaviour
An additional avenue to help spread awareness of the OpenUI mission, people learning via the research may discover the UI components and vice versa.

One thing that could be useful is to create the web components, that the React components use internally.

Note, this library my also work best as a web-components library, so it's language agnostic.


## Getting Started
