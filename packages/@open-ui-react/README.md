# OpenUI React

OpenUI is the set of in-progress specifications for accessible and usable native web components.

OpenUI React lets you use these specifications in ready-to-use components. The behaviour of each component will correspond to the specification outlined [here](https://open-ui.org/).

This component library sets all of the necessary defaults to ensure that your UI is both usable and accessible. The API of this form library is also designed to map as close to the expected native behaviour as possible, as a result this component library would be made redundant as the OpenUI specs get baked into browsers.

This means that aside from sane default styling, the styling of the components is left up to you, the developer.

OpenUI React is still a work in progress
OpenUI React can also be a way to gain feedback on how components are used in the wild


Why do I want to make OpenUI React?

Help learn more about creating UI
Use the expertise of a number of industry professionals to inform the UI behaviour
An additional avenue to help spread awareness of the OpenUI mission, people learning via the research may discover the UI components and vice versa.

One thing that could be useful is to create the web components, that the React components use internally.

Note, this library my also work best as a web-components library, so it's language agnostic.
