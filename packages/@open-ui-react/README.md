# OpenUI React

OpenUI is the set of in-progress specifications for accessible and usable native web components.

OpenUI React lets you use these specifications in ready-to-use JavaScript components. The behaviour of each component will correspond to the specification outlined [here](https://open-ui.org/).

This component library sets all of the necessary defaults to ensure that your UI is both usable and accessible. The API of this library is also designed to map as close to the OpenUI's proposed behaviour as possible. As a result, when the OpenUI specifications make it to the browsers, this component library would be made mostly redundant.

While this library employs sane styling and behaviour, the visuals are left to be implemented in user land.

OpenUI React was made to bring the OpenUI specific behaviour to the browser now. It's also a way to evaluate usage and understand how the components are being used in the wild.

It's very much a work in progress, so all feedback and contributions will be welcome.

Why do I want to make OpenUI React?

Help learn more about creating UI
Use the expertise of a number of industry professionals to inform the UI behaviour
An additional avenue to help spread awareness of the OpenUI mission, people learning via the research may discover the UI components and vice versa.

One thing that could be useful is to create the web components, that the React components use internally.

Note, this library my also work best as a web-components library, so it's language agnostic.
