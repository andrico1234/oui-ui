# Tutorial Intro

Welcome to the unofficial open ui web components.

## Getting Started

Get started by downloading the components that you need.

If you want to test out in the browser you can use unpkg

Or install via nyarn if you'd like to develop in a node environment

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**:

```shell
npx @docusaurus/init@latest init my-website classic
```

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```shell
cd my-website

npx docusaurus start
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and display your changes.
