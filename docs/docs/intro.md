# OpenUI UI (oui-ui)

Welcome to the unofficial OpenUI UI library, or oui-ui for short.

Why the ridiculous name? oui-ui is a set of web components that adheres to the research and proposals conducted by the OpenUI working group, hence the name **OpenUI UI**.

For those unfamiliar with the OpenUI project, according to the [OpenUI site](https://open-ui.org/):

> The purpose of Open UI to the web platform is to allow web developers to style and extend built-in web UI controls, such as `<select>` dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, and date/color pickers.
>
> Long term, we hope that Open UI will establish a standard process for developing high-quality UI controls suitable for addition to the web platform.

oui-ui is the implementation of these proposed UI controls as web component library, and so can be used with HTML, or with a framework like React or Vue.

## Usage

## Components

Currently, oui-ui only exports a single checkbox component.
