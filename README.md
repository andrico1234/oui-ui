# OpenUI UI (oui-ui)

Welcome to the unofficial OpenUI UI library, or oui-ui for short.

A set of web components that adhere to the research and proposals conducting by the OpenUI working group. According to the [OpenUI site](https://open-ui.org/):

The purpose of Open UI to the web platform is to allow web developers to style and extend built-in web UI controls, such as `<select>` dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, and date/color pickers.

Long term, we hope that Open UI will establish a standard process for developing high-quality UI controls suitable for addition to the web platform.

Oui-ui is designed to be used anywhere on the web, regardless of whether you choose to use a framework like React.
