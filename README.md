Welcome to the unofficial OpenUI UI library, or oui-ui for short.

Note: This is currently a library I'm developing to learn web components. It's best not to use this in production.

If you'd like to see a demo, you can check out the [oui-ui documentation site](https://loving-hamilton-660a1a.netlify.app/)

What's OpenUI? According to the [OpenUI site](https://open-ui.org/):

> The purpose of Open UI to the web platform is to allow web developers to style and extend built-in web UI controls, such as `<select>` dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, and date/color pickers.
>
> Long term, we hope that Open UI will establish a standard process for developing high-quality UI controls suitable for addition to the web platform.

oui-ui is the implementation of these proposed UI controls as a web component library, and so can be used with HTML, or with a framework like React or Vue.

## Usage

If you want to get started, you can follow along to the [checkbox quick start](https://loving-hamilton-660a1a.netlify.app/checkbox/overview/quick-start)

## Components

Currently, oui-ui only exports a single checkbox component.

| Component                                                                             |

-   install dependencies using `yarn`.
-   ensure the tests are passing by running `yarn test`.
-   kick off the dev server by running `yarn develop`.
-   run the docs site locally using `yarn docs:start`.
-   jump into whichever you package you want to change
-   view your changes in your locally running docs
